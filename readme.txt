Visma Pay plugin for Woocommerce.

== Description ==

This plugin uses the Visma Pay Payment API. 

This is a plugin for integrating Visma Pay payment gateway with your Woocommerce store. To accept card payments with this plugin, you need to have an active contract with [Visma Pay](https://www.visma.fi/vismapay/). You can order Visma Pay [here](https://www.visma.fi/vismapay/tilaa-visma-pay/) (See [terms](https://static.vismapay.com/terms/yleiset-ehdot.pdf)).

Compared to the normal Visma Pay payment gateway this plugin embeds a card payment form on your checkout and supports recurring payment using Woocommerce Subscriptions.
